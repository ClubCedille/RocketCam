# Note on the keys
---
We know that including keys is generally not a good choice.

We included them in the project to reduce some risk associated with the installation 
of the master and slave.

This software will be put in few raspbery pi zero w that will be embedded in a rocket.
They will only be used for this purpose and offline.

If you plan to use this project to do anything connected to the internet, please take the time
to regenerate your own private/public keys.
